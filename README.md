# DLM-Code

This repository includes all the Matlab codes for the manuscript titled "Peak Inference for Gaussian Random Fields on a Lattice." This method is to compute the height distribution of local maxima of a stationary Gaussian or Gaussian-related random field that is observed on a regular lattice. 

The main function is named "MCDLM.m" under the folder "../MCDLM/main function". All other codes for running simulation and real examples in the manuscript are also included.
